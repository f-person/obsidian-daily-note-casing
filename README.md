if you're like me & prefer lowercase text or filenames, this plugin is for u ðŸ’–

this plugin lets you lowercase or UPPERCASE your daily notes upon creation,
so `Sep 15, 2024, Sun` becomes `sep 15, 2024, sun`, or  `24 apr, 1915` -> `24 APR, 1915`.

# configuration
the plugin has a few settings, check them out if you'd like some config.
otherwise, you only need to set `daily note date format` to get the plugin working.

## daily note date format
> no default value, the plugin won't work until you set this value.

the date format that the daily notes plugin uses. copy it over from the 
settings of daily notes (obsidian settings -> core plugins -> daily notes -> date format).

## casing
> default value: `lowercase`

this plugin can convert the daily note casing to either full `lowercase`
or `UPPERCASE` (if u want that).

## notice on rename
> default value: `off`

whether the plugin should notify u that it renamed a created daily note.
i think it's pretty distracting, but maybe u want to know idk Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
