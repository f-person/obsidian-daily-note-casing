if you prefer your filenames lowercase or UPPERCASE, this plugin is for u ðŸ’–

it will convert the name of your daily notes to your preferred case upon creation,
so `Sep 15, 2024, Sun` will be `sep 15, 2024, sun`, or  `24 apr, 1915` -> `24 APR, 1915`.

# configuration
the plugin has a couple of settings u can optionally tweak to your liking:

## casing
> default value: `lowercase`

this plugin can convert the daily note casing to either full `lowercase`
or `UPPERCASE` (if u want that).

## notice on rename
> default value: `off`

whether the plugin should notify u that it renamed a created daily note.
i think it's pretty distracting, but maybe u want to know idk Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

# batch renaming
if u have a bunch of daily notes from the past & you'd like to batch-rename
them to match your preferred case, run the "daily notes: set case for all" command

TODO(f-person): implement the batch-rename command.
consider showing the results of the batch rename and adding a confirmation dialog.
