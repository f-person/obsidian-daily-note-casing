if you prefer your filenames lowercase or UPPERCASE, this plugin is for u ðŸ’–

it will convert the name of your daily note to your preferred case upon creation,
so `Sep 15, 2024, Sun` will be `sep 15, 2024, sun`, or  `24 apr, 1915` -> `24 APR, 1915`.

# configuration
the plugin has a few settings, check them out if you'd like some config.
otherwise, you only need to set `daily note date format` to get the plugin working.

## daily note date format
> no default value, the plugin won't work until you set this value.

the date format that the daily notes plugin uses. copy it over from the 
settings of daily notes (obsidian settings -> core plugins -> daily notes -> date format).

## casing
> default value: `lowercase`

this plugin can convert the daily note casing to either full `lowercase`
or `UPPERCASE` (if u want that).

## notice on rename
> default value: `off`

whether the plugin should notify u that it renamed a created daily note.
i think it's pretty distracting, but maybe u want to know idk Â¯\\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

# batch renaming
if u have a bunch of daily notes from the past & you'd like to batch-rename
them to match your preferred case, run the "daily notes: set case for all" command

TODO(f-person): implement the batch-rename command.
consider showing the results of the batch rename and adding a confirmation dialog.
